The magnetic field integral has a proper value for L=1 of 8.994430382*10-8 and a trapezoidal error of roughly 3.56 * 10-4%.

The Gaussian error is roughly 3.72 * 10-4%.

The conclusion is quite accurate because we assumed that the step size of the trapezoidal function was very tiny and that the gaussian function may be roughly approximated by a polynomial of degree 10 (as z moves from -0.5 to 0.5).




When the integral is solved, the magnetic field value for L=100 is 1.99960612*10-9. Approximately 9.6% of the mistake comes from the trapezoidal, whereas 266% of the error comes from the gaussian.

The 9.6% inaccuracy of the trapezoidal approach cannot be determined precisely because the step size is too large.

In this instance, we have taken the degree of the polynomial to be 10 because we are unable to reasonably approximate the integrand to a polynomial (for which z fluctuates from -50 to 50). This is what causes the gaussian distribution to be quite inaccurate.
